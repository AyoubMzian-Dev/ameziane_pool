# Exercise 02: ft_rev_params

**Program:** `ft_rev_params`

**Description:** Write a program that displays its given arguments. Each argument should be printed on a new line, in the reverse order from the command line. The program should display all arguments except `argv[0]`.

**Allowed functions:** `write`

**Key Points:**
- The program must have a `main` function.
- The arguments are stored in `argv`.
- We loop from `argc - 1` down to 1 to print each argument in reverse order.
