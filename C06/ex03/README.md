# Exercise 03: ft_sort_params

**Program:** `ft_sort_params`

**Description:** Write a program that displays its given arguments sorted in ASCII order. The program should display all arguments except `argv[0]`. Each argument should be printed on a new line.

**Allowed functions:** `write`

**Key Points:**
- The program must have a `main` function.
- We use a bubble sort algorithm to sort the arguments.
- A helper function `ft_strcmp` is used to compare two strings based on their ASCII values.
- After sorting, we print the arguments.
