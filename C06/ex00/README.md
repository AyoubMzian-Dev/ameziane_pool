# Exercise 00: ft_print_program_name

**Program:** `ft_print_program_name`

**Description:** Write a program that displays its own name, followed by a new line.

**Allowed functions:** `write`

**Key Points:**
- The program must have a `main` function.
- The name of the program is stored in `argv[0]`.
- `argv` is an array of strings, and `argc` is the number of arguments.
- We use a helper function `ft_putstr` to print the string.
