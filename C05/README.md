# C05 - Recursion, Iteration, and Mathematical Functions

## ðŸ“‹ Module Overview

This module focuses on implementing various mathematical functions using both iterative and recursive approaches. It deepens the understanding of algorithmic thinking, efficiency, and problem-solving strategies, including classic computer science problems.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

-   Understand and implement iterative solutions for mathematical problems.
-   Understand and implement recursive solutions for mathematical problems.
-   Compare and contrast iterative and recursive approaches.
-   Develop algorithms for common mathematical sequences (e.g., Fibonacci).
-   Implement functions for numerical properties (e.g., square root, primality test).
-   Tackle complex combinatorial problems (e.g., N-Queens puzzle).

-   **ex08**: `ft_ten_queens_puzzle` - Solve the N-Queens puzzle for N=10.

## ðŸ”§ Key Concepts

-   **Iteration**: Using loops (`for`, `while`) to repeat operations.
-   **Recursion**: Functions calling themselves, base cases, recursive steps.
-   **Factorial**: Product of all positive integers up to a given number.
-   **Power**: Base raised to an exponent.
-   **Fibonacci Sequence**: Series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

-   **Primality Test**: Determining if a number is prime.
-   **Square Root**: Finding the integer square root.
-   **Backtracking**: Algorithmic technique for solving combinatorial problems (N-Queens).

```

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

-   All exercises must adhere to the `norminette` coding standard.
-   Only allowed functions are typically `write` (for output) and basic arithmetic operations.
-   Pay attention to integer overflow for large numbers (e.g., factorial, power).
-   For recursive functions, ensure a clear base case to prevent infinite recursion.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success

1.  **Base Cases**: Always define the base case(s) for recursive functions first.
2.  **Recursive Step**: Define how the problem breaks down into smaller, similar subproblems.
3.  **Iterative vs. Recursive**: Understand when one approach might be more suitable or efficient than the other.
4.  **Optimization**: For prime number checks, optimize by checking divisors only up to the square root.
5.  **N-Queens**: This is a classic backtracking problem; drawing the board and tracing the algorithm can be very helpful.
