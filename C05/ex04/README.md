# Exercise 04: ft_fibonacci

- Create a function ft_fibonacci, that returns the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence, with the first element at index 0. The Fibonacci sequence will be considered to start as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2.
- Overflows do not need to be handled; the functionâ€™s return value will be undefined in such cases.
- The function should be prototyped as follows:
  `int ft_fibonacci(int index);`
- ft_fibonacci must be implemented recursively.
- If index is less than 0, the function should return -1.
