# Exercise 02: ft_iterative_power

- Create an iterative function that returns the result of raising a number to a given power.
- If the power is less than 0, the function should return 0.
- Overflows do not need to be handled.
- By definition, 0 raised to the power of 0 should return 1.
- The function should be prototyped as follows:
  `int ft_iterative_power(int nb, int power);`
