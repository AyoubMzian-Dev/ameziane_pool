# Exercise 03: ft_recursive_power

- Create a recursive function that returns the result of raising a number to a given power.
- If the power is less than 0, the function should return 0.
- Overflows do not need to be handled; the functionâ€™s return value will be undefined in such cases.
- By definition, 0 raised to the power of 0 should return 1.
- The function should be prototyped as follows:
  `int ft_recursive_power(int nb, int power);`
