# Exercise 08: The Ten Queens

- Create a function that displays all possible placements of ten queens on a 10Ã—10 chessboard, ensuring that no two queens can attack each other in a single move. The function should return the total number of valid solutions.
- Recursion is required to solve this problem.
- The function should be prototyped as follows:
  `int ft_ten_queens_puzzle(void);`
- The output should be the row positions for each column, like `0257948136`.
