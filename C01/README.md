# C01 - Pointers and Arrays

## ðŸ“‹ Module Overview

This module is a foundational step into C programming, focusing exclusively on the powerful concepts of pointers and arrays. It aims to solidify understanding of memory manipulation, indirect addressing, and efficient data handling, which are crucial for advanced C development.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

-   Master pointer declaration, initialization, and dereferencing.
-   Understand and apply pass-by-reference using pointers to modify variables.
-   Work with multiple levels of indirection (pointers to pointers).
-   Manipulate arrays, including reversing and sorting their elements.
-   Gain proficiency in basic string (char array) operations.

## ðŸ“š Exercises

### Mandatory Exercises

-   **ex00**: `ft_ft` - Set an integer value through a pointer.
-   **ex01**: `ft_ultimate_ft` - Set an integer value through nine levels of pointers.
-   **ex02**: `ft_swap` - Swap two integer values using pointers.
-   **ex03**: `ft_div_mod` - Calculate division and modulo, storing results via pointers.
-   **ex04**: `ft_ultimate_div_mod` - Calculate division and modulo, storing results via double pointers.
-   **ex05**: `ft_putstr` - Display a string to standard output.
-   **ex06**: `ft_strlen` - Return the length of a string.
-   **ex07**: `ft_rev_int_tab` - Reverse the elements of an integer array.
-   **ex08**: `ft_sort_int_tab` - Sort an integer array in ascending order.

## ðŸ”§ Key Concepts

-   **Pointers**: Memory addresses, `&` (address-of), `*` (dereference).
-   **Indirection**: Single and multiple levels of pointer indirection.
-   **Arrays**: Contiguous memory blocks, array-pointer duality.
-   **Strings**: Null-terminated character arrays.
-   **Pass by Reference**: Modifying original variables in calling functions.
-   **Algorithms**: Basic sorting (e.g., Bubble Sort) and array manipulation.

## ðŸ“Š Difficulty Progression

```
Simple    â†’    Moderate    â†’    Complex    â†’    Advanced
ex00-04        ex05-06         ex07           ex08
```

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

-   All exercises must adhere to the `norminette` coding standard.
-   Only allowed functions are typically `write` (for output) and basic arithmetic operations.
-   Pay close attention to pointer types and levels of indirection.
-   Edge cases (e.g., empty strings, arrays of size 1) should be considered.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success

1.  **Draw Diagrams**: Visualize memory addresses and pointer relationships.
2.  **Trace Code**: Manually trace pointer values and dereferencing steps.
3.  **Start Simple**: Master single pointers before moving to multiple indirections.
4.  **Test Thoroughly**: Create small `main` functions to test each exercise.
5.  **Understand Null Terminator**: Crucial for string manipulation.
