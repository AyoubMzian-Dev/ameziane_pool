Welcome to my repository for the 1337 (42 Network) C Piscine! This repository documents my journey through the intensive and immersive C programming bootcamp. It contains all the exercises, projects, and exams I completed.

## 🌊 About the Piscine

The C Piscine at 1337 is a month-long, intensive coding bootcamp designed to build a strong foundation in C programming. It's famous for its peer-to-peer learning methodology, hands-on projects, and a demanding schedule that pushes students to their limits. The goal is not just to learn to code, but to learn how to learn effectively.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized into modules, each corresponding to a set of concepts and exercises from the Piscine.

## 📚 Modules Overview

### C Modules (C00 to C12)
A deep dive into the C programming language, from the very basics to advanced topics.

- **C00:** Introduction to the shell, basic commands, and first C programs (`ft_putchar`, etc.).
- **C01:** Pointers, memory addresses, and manipulation.
- **C02:** String handling, arrays, and implementing standard string functions.
- **C03:** Advanced string functions (`ft_strcmp`, `ft_strncat`).
- **C04:** More string manipulation and number conversions (`ft_atoi`).
- **C05:** Mathematical functions, including recursive and iterative solutions (`ft_sqrt`, `ft_fibonacci`).
- **C06:** Program arguments (`argc`, `argv`).
- **C07:** Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`).
- **C08:** Structures, `makefiles`, and header files.
- **C09:** Advanced C concepts like function pointers.
- **C10:** File I/O and error handling.
- **C11:** Linked lists and other data structures.
- **C12:** Advanced algorithms and data structures.

### Shell Modules (Shell00, Shell01)
Mastering the command line and shell scripting.

- **Shell00:** Unix basics, file system navigation, and permissions.
- **Shell01:** Shell scripting, environment variables, and automation.

### "Rushes" (Group Projects)
Intensive weekend projects done in groups to solve a larger problem under time pressure.

- **Rush00:** Create a program that displays a pattern of characters.
- **Rush01:** A logic puzzle solver (Skyscraper).
- **Rush02:** A program that converts numbers into words.

### Exams
A collection of practice exams to prepare for the final exam.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To compile any of the C exercises, you can use a standard C compiler like `gcc`.

```bash
# Navigate to an exercise directory
cd C00/ex00

# Compile the .c file
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror ft_putchar.c

# Run the executable
./a.out
```

### The Norm

All C code in this repository is written to comply with the "Norminette," the coding standard at 42/1337. This standard enforces strict rules about formatting, naming, and structure to ensure code is readable and maintainable.
