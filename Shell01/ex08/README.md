# Exercise 08: add_chelou

## Objective

Write a command line that:
- takes numbers from variables `FT_NBR1`, in `'"?!` base and `FT_NBR2`, in `mrdoc` base.
- Displays the sum of both in the `gtaio luSnemf` base.

## Status

**Not Solved**

## Reason

This exercise is intentionally obscure and complex. The "bases" are not standard, and the expected output "Segmentation fault" for one of the examples suggests that it's a trick question rather than a standard shell scripting problem. A reliable and portable solution is not feasible without making significant assumptions or using non-standard tools.
